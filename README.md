# This Repo

Search-pokemon app create by Next.JS using TypeScript.
This repo does not included rthe optional test as I doesn't have any knowledge on how to do that.

## My self

This is my first time creating a Next.JS Front-end App as i only used it for Back-end side only.

## Design

This app is design to have 2 pages. The first one is the overview page for the list of all pokemon and can also search the list of pokemon that included the keyword.
Another page is the full detail of each pokemon. to access this page click on any pokemon on the first page. You can also click the evolution of the pokemon and you can see the full detail of the clicked pokemon.
